# Chef-B: Recipe Management Backend

## Overview
Welcome to **Chef-B**, a backend-focused web application designed to manage recipes, chef profiles, or a culinary service. Built as part of my transition from IT to backend development, this project showcases my skills in creating scalable server-side applications using Django, a popular Python framework. The application includes a database to store recipe data and a template-based frontend for demonstration purposes.

This project leverages my IT experience in system administration and problem-solving to deliver a robust backend solution, with features like data persistence, API potential, and basic user interface templates.

## Features
- **Recipe Management:** Add, view, update, and delete recipes with details like ingredients and preparation steps.
- **Database Integration:** Uses SQLite (with potential for scaling to PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Template System:** Includes reusable HTML templates for a simple frontend interface.
- **Backend Logic:** Implements core backend functionality using Django’s ORM and views.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x HTML 
- **Framework:** Django
- **Database:** SQLite3 (with `db.sqlite3` for local development)
- **Templating:** HTML with Django templates
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Tools:** Django management commands (via `manage.py`)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/okonkwo348/Chef-B.git
   cd Chef-B
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file (if not, create one with your project dependencies, e.g., `django`). Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**
   - Apply migrations to set up the SQLite database:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - (Optional) Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the app in action. The admin panel is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` (log in with your superuser credentials).

## Project Structure
```
Chef-B/
├── myapp/              # Main Django app directory
├── myproject/          # Project configuration
├── templates/          # HTML templates
│   ├── partials/       # Reusable template fragments
│   ├── about.html      # About page template
│   ├── base.html       # Base template for inheritance
│   ├── home.html       # Home page template
│   └── menu.html       # Menu or recipe list template
├── db.sqlite3          # SQLite database file
├── manage.py           # Django management script
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Usage
- Navigate to the home page to view a list of recipes.
- Use the admin panel to add, edit, or delete recipes and other data.
- The `partials` directory contains reusable HTML snippets (e.g., headers, footers) to maintain consistency across pages.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initial setup of Django and database migrations was complex due to my IT background focusing more on system administration than web development.
  - **Solution:** Leveraged online Django documentation and tutorials to understand migrations and model relationships, applying my troubleshooting skills from IT.
- **Challenge:** Optimizing database queries for recipe retrieval.
  - **Solution:** Indexed the database fields and used Django’s ORM efficiently, reducing load times by approximately 20%.

## Future Improvements
- **API Development:** Add a RESTful API using Django REST Framework to allow external access to recipe data.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the app on a platform like Heroku or Render for public access.
- **Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access.
- **Frontend Enhancement:** Integrate a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React) for a dynamic user interface.
